# Ignaz Pleyel â€“ String Quartets

In his own time, Ignaz Pleyel's fame may have surpassed that of Mozart or Haydn. Today, his music is rarely performed, though the piano manufacturer he founded, Pleyel & Cie., survives to this day. These two string quartets are quite early works, completed before the composer left Austria for Alsace and truly launched his career. While Pleyel's mature works gained a reputation (perhaps unearned) for being simple and didactic, these Quartets engage in their own share of instrumental pyrotechnics. Our annotations for these works illustrate what is arguably the ideal archetypical Classical style and have proven useful in establishing an analytical paradigm for our research efforts.
